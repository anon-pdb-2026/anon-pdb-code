PART 2: A correct solution to the task.

First, read both the task description and the provided solution to understand what the code is supposed to do.
Then, your task is to perform a deep rewriting (perturbation) of the solution code WITHOUT changing its functionality.
Strictly adhere to the following rules:
    - Do NOT change the starter code as given in the task description.
    - Do NOT add any new comments.
    - Do NOT make shallow redundancy edits, such as a = 1 + 2 - 1.
    - Do NOT condense the code to very short format.
    - NEVER rename variables to very short names (e.g., sum_production -> p), but you can give variables wrong names.
    - The rewritten code should resemble what human will write and should NOT be hard for human to read.
    - The rewritten code should be different enough from the original code.
You can probably use the following hints:
    - Change loop syntax (e.g., for to while or vice versa, if applicable)
    - Convert recursion to iteration or vice versa (if functionally equivalent)
    - Invert control flow where logical structure remains the same (e.g., replace `if not ...` with an inverted block)
    - Merge or flatten adjacent or nested if blocks.

Instructions for modifying the code:
- ONLY modify ONE selected line to induce a HARD bug to the task.
- Keep the other lines of the code solution EXACTLY the SAME.
- Do NOT add any new comments to the modified line.
- DO NOT introduce easy bugs such as referencing variable names before declaration, adding typos or commas.

IntroduceMultilineBug.__doc__ = f"""Your task is to introduce ONE realistic, human-authored bug that spans a contiguous
BLOCK of {MIN_MULTILINES} to {MAX_MULTILINES} CONSECUTIVE lines in a Python solution.

Think like a sleep-deprived engineer reviewing their own code — the bug should be a plausible
slip a real developer might commit, not an obviously synthetic corruption.

You will be given:
PART 1: A task description.
PART 2: A correct solution.
PART 3: A set of contiguous line RANGES you may choose from (e.g., "Lines 10-13").

Pick exactly ONE of the given ranges. Within that range, change {MIN_MULTILINES}-{MAX_MULTILINES} consecutive lines.

GOOD multiline bug patterns to draw inspiration from:
- Flip a loop/branch condition AND mis-adjust a dependent expression in the next line(s)
  (e.g., `for i in range(n):` -> `for i in range(n-1):` together with `x[i+1] = ...` -> `x[i] = ...`).
- Off-by-one in a bound AND a corresponding off-by-one in an index or slice on a following line.
- Negate a guard AND drop the compensating branch body (swap then/else behavior).
- Swap two related variables across consecutive assignments (group1 / group2 aliasing).
- Replace a correct function call pair where both calls have their argument order subtly wrong.
- Forget to update one side of a symmetric two-line update (update left, forget right).

You may BLEND bug categories when it is natural. A Checking flip on one line can cascade into
an Assignment correction on the next line — that is exactly what real human bugs look like.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only change lines within ONE of the given contiguous ranges; keep every other line EXACTLY the same.
- All changed lines must be CONSECUTIVE (no gaps between modified lines).
- Number of changed lines: {MIN_MULTILINES} to {MAX_MULTILINES}.
- Every changed line must change RUNTIME BEHAVIOR. Comment-only edits, whitespace edits, or
  consistent variable renames do NOT count and will be rejected.
- Each changed line must be ESSENTIAL. If one edit could be reverted to the GT while the rest
  still cause a test failure, that edit was not essential — drop it and pick a block where
  every line genuinely contributes.
- DO NOT invent fake library APIs (e.g., `server.bind_address`, `server.listen_backlog`,
  `platform.linux_distribution` on Python 3.8+). Use real Python / stdlib / common-library names.
  If a real API doesn't exist, pick a different bug.
- DO NOT introduce trivial bugs: typos, syntax errors, undefined variables, missing imports,
  or deleting a for/if/while/with/try header without its body.
- Preserve indentation of surrounding code.
- Do NOT add comments to modified lines, AND do NOT replace an existing line with a comment.
- Do NOT delete the header of a control-flow block (if/for/while/with/try/except) while keeping
  the body — this creates unreachable or nonsensical code.

BAD BUG EXAMPLES — never produce output that matches these patterns:

(A) Deletion causing syntax errors:
       ORIG:
         if os.path.exists(plot_path):
             plt.savefig(plot_path)
         plt.close()
       BAD BUGGY:
             plt.savefig(plot_path)           <-- header deleted, structure broken
         plt.close()

(B) Fake APIs that don't exist: `server.bind_address(host, port)`,
    `server.listen_backlog(5)`, `msg.set_content(subject)` when msg is an email.MIMEText,
    `platform.linux_distribution()` on Python 3.8+.

(C) Non-atomic edits: a block where reverting any single line to the GT would still leave
    the tests failing. That means only the non-reverted lines caused the failure, and the
    reverted line was superfluous.

Output:
- The subtype label for the introduced bug (if mixed, pick the dominant one or "Others").
- The full buggy code with exactly one contiguous block of {MIN_MULTILINES}-{MAX_MULTILINES} lines changed."""
